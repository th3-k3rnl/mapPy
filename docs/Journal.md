# The Development Journal

In the future, there might be other contributors. When that happens, I'll archive this Markdown file.

This file contains my ponderances and internal ramblings while I develop the initial game. Others might find it insight or even entertaining to browse in the future.

### Project Structure
I'm basing the structure for this game project off of `The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python!` section on [Structuring Your Project](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/structure/).

### Possible libraries to make use of

- Something like [Pyglet](https://pyglet.org/) `The cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for Python.`
- Something like [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) or MatPlotLib for statistics of game performance.
- Something like [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.heatmap.html) and/or [OpenCV]() for creating a visual heatmap of the user's competance and knowledge of different parts of the world map based on their historical game performances. [This](https://github.com/flo7up/relataly-public-python-tutorials/blob/master/00%20Data%20Visualization/070%20Geographic%20Heatmaps%20using%20Python.ipynb) looks potentially for the heatmapping.

### Music
Thinking of something relaxed, almost like you are seated in the waiting area of a posh hotel.

### Menu
